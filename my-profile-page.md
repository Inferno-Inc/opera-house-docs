Here the platform will display all NFTs you have that are either:

* Part of a collection listed on Opera House, or
* Part of one of the default collections of Opera Houseâ„¢

So if you don't see all of your NFTs in there, don't worry, it is supposed to show only tracked collections. To see all your NFTs, including those not tracked by Opera House you can use NovaSwap instead.
