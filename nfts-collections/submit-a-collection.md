# Submit a Collection

To submit your collection, all you need to do is to fill and submit a form with your collection's details. Currently this service is free of charge, and you can access the form via **Resources > Submit Collection** in the main menu.

We normally process collection requests very quickly, but if you have any urgency to have your collection listed, please get in touch with us after submitting your request.
