# NFT Details Page

After clicking on a specific NFT card, you will be directed to that particular NFT details page. There you will find key information about the NFT, such as the description, the price, the royalty that is paid to the artist, the NFT's attributes, transaction history, etc.

We are working to have an ever more comprehensive details page, where users will be able to fetch stats and data that will help them on assessing their purchase quickly and efficiently.
