# Users' FAQ

### Can I create an NFT for free with Opera House**?**

Yes. You will only have to pay the gas fees, but we do not charge anything for you to mint an NFT using our default collection.

### I am a creator, can I submit my collection for free?

Yes, we currently do not charge for listing collections. All you need to do is to fill out the form, send you collection information, and we will get it listed.

### Can I use Opera House **with Ethereum or BSC?**

Not currently. We might be implementing support to additional networks in the future, but as of now, we are only compatible with Fantom Opera Network.

### My NFTs are not showing, what is the problem?

You will only be able to see NFTs you own **and are tracked by Opera House** under your Profile page. If you have an NFT of a collection that is not listed in our platform, it will not display. You can instead use NovaSwap to see your full collection of NFTs.

### NFTs are not displaying. What could be the cause?

You can perform a few checks and actions to try to solve this problem:

* Make sure your MetaMask wallet is connected
* Try refreshing the page pressing CTRL+F5
* Try navigating back to the home page

If nothing of the above has fixed the problem, please get in touch with us.

### My question is not listed, where to find support?

You can send an email to [operahouse@novanetwork.io](mailto:operahouse@novanetwork.io) for non-urgent queries, and if your problem needs urgent attention, we recommend you to seek support via our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mHtRYmd).
