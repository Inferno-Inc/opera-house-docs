# Marketplace & Buying NFTs

### Marketplace

The marketplace houses all NFTs that are for sale by users, and we will be implementing filters to facilitate users to navigate through them. There you will see the individual NFT cards - like the image below - and you will be able to buy the NFTs using the "Buy Now" button or click on the card to go to the NFT Details Page.

### Buying NFTs

Overall, users will have several places from which they can buy a specific NFT, so all you need to do when you find the NFT you want to buy, is to look for the "Buy Now" button. If you don't see the option to buy the NFT, that is because it isn't for sale and it's being shown as part of a listed collection.
