# Introduction

![](<.gitbook/assets/OH Logo Round.png>)

Opera House is our proprietary NFT Marketplace. It is native to the Fantom Opera Network - with multichain compatibility in the works - and we have designed it from the group up as platform built for creators and users to display and sell their NFT work.

Unlike many existing platforms, Opera House isn't a fork from any other existing NFT marketplace, and has been uniquely crafted to serve our vision as to how a proper NFT marketplace should look like. This enables us to create and implement updates in a much more flexible and comprehensive way, and allows us to run it as an ever-evolving platform, capable of adapting to, and exceeding our community's expectations.
